# Brief description


OrbMod (Orbit Modeling ) - tools for numerical modeling of orbits. Orbit propagation and fitting to observations. Orbit modeling is implemented  within the perturbed  two-body problem, in Cartesian, Kustaanheimo-Stiefel (KS) and Sperling-Burdet (SB) variables.

In this software, [SPICE](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/)  routines and kernels are used for coorinate and time frames transformation, ephemeris computation. 

The graphic user interface (written on C#) for this software is available here: https://github.com/vdmitriev90/OrbMod_DotNET_UI 

Pre-build binaries for OrbMod as well as for UI, auxiliary libraris, all required SPICE kernels and input files is available here: https://github.com/vdmitriev90/OrbMod_bin
